## Tutorial 03 - Firebase Auth and Cloud Functions (Generate Stream user tokens)

This branch is the final code for tutorial 03. In this tutorial we add [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) authentication to authenticate users. After they are authenticated we use Firebase Cloud Functions to securely generate Stream API user tokens.

There is also a [written guide](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/flutter/guides/token_generation_with_firebase/) showing how to securely generate Stream user tokens using Firebase Cloud Functions.
